# Product Description Feature

## Overview
All 104,042 components in the mock database now include detailed, LCSC-style product descriptions. The descriptions are displayed in the stock browser and can be searched.

## What Was Added

### 1. Product Descriptions (`productIntroEn`)
Every component in `tests/mock_products_large.json` now has a comprehensive description including:
- **Technical Specifications**: Resistance, capacitance, voltage ratings, etc.
- **Features**: Temperature coefficients, ESR, dielectric types, etc.
- **Applications**: Typical use cases and circuit applications
- **Compliance**: RoHS compliance and standards
- **Package Details**: SMD/through-hole mounting information

### 2. Stock Browser Enhancements
**File**: `src/lhatolcsc/gui/stock_browser.py`

#### New Description Column
- Added "Description" column to the main product list
- Shows truncated description (80 characters) with "..." for longer text
- Full description visible on double-click in details window
- Column width: 400 pixels for readability

#### Updated Layout
- Window size increased to 1600x700 for better display
- Minimum size: 1200x600
- Description column positioned between Package and Stock

#### Search Capability
- Info label updated: "Search in code, model, name, and description"
- Search now finds products by any text in their descriptions
- Example searches:
  - "multilayer" - finds MLCC capacitors
  - "temperature coefficient" - finds resistors
  - "microcontroller" - finds MCU components
  - "RoHS compliant" - finds all compliant parts

### 3. Mock Server Search Enhancement
**File**: `tests/mock_lcsc_server.py`

Updated search endpoint to search in:
- `productModel` (model number)
- `productName` (product name)
- `productCode` (component code)
- **`productIntroEn` (description)** ‚Üê NEW

```python
if (keyword in product['productModel'].lower() or
    keyword in product['productName'].lower() or
    keyword in code.lower() or
    keyword in product.get('productIntroEn', '').lower()):
```

### 4. CSV Export Enhancement
**File**: `src/lhatolcsc/gui/stock_browser.py`

CSV exports now include the "Description" column between "Package" and "Stock":
```csv
Product Code,Product Number,Name,Manufacturer,MPN,Category,Package,Description,Stock,...
```

GPIO pins, peripherals including UART, SPI, I2C, ADC, timers, and PWM. Suitable for 
embedded systems, IoT devices, motor control, sensor interfacing, and industrial 
automation. Low power consumption with multiple sleep modes. Wide operating voltage 
range. Comprehensive development tools and software libraries available. RoHS 
compliant.
```

### Sensors
```
Capacitive relative humidity sensor with ¬±3% accuracy over 0-100%RH. QFN-8 SMD 
package with digital or analog output. Features fast response time, low hysteresis, 
and excellent long-term stability. Integrated temperature sensor for dew point 
calculation. Suitable for weather stations, HVAC systems, industrial drying, 
agriculture, and consumer electronics. Factory calibrated with interchangeable 
without recalibration. RoHS compliant.

## Testing

### Mock Server Running
```
üóÑÔ∏è  Product Database: 104,042 components (LARGE DATABASE)
   Product codes: C100000 to C204041
```

### Verify Description
```python
import json
data = json.load(open('tests/mock_products_large.json'))
sample = list(data.values())[0]
print(sample['productIntroEn'][:200])
```

## Benefits
